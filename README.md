# to-do-list-cli
simple to-do list application using cli.
this project allowed me to leverage i/o classes and better understand streams. 
it allowed exercise project structuring, utilizing service packages and repos. 
Worked on better understanding reading and writing to a file and why it differs from other storage methods. 

note: all my projects are approached with the mentality of seeking desired difficulty. this means I mentally tax my own mind to try and solve the problem. 
only after a period of 20-45 minutes, if I still can't figure out a specific feature/problem, I will consult an LLM or online resources (official documentation is leveraged regardless).
